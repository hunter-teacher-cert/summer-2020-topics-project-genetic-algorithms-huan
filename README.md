## Educator Resources for Learning about Genetic Algorithms
* https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zfeTw-uFCw&feature=emb_logo (This is the first of an extensive set of videos of live-coded genetic algorithms in JavaScript; it is the YouTube series version of the book above)
* http://boxcar2d.com/about.html (explains algorithm for orignal Flash boxcar2d, which you can still open in 2020 by allowing Flash in your browser settings)
* http://moe.stuy.edu/~dw/boxcardw/ (to get around Flash issues, you can alternatively play around with this version hosted by Stuyvesant)

## Educator Resources for Learning Scratch
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSgUBfi51uldLxNsADEYyXoXMuBTuR7om (Playlist tutorial for Scratch)
* https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Kids-Scratch-Coding-Book/dp/1507207972/ (Designed for kids, but useful for adults too)

## Educator Resources for Reviewing Biological Evolution 
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTftyFboC_M (Natural Selection with classic peppered moths example that is relevant to lesson materials)

## Lesson Materials

Version 1 of Moth Evolution Simulation (uses averages of parent color values instead of crossing over): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/413457430/editor/

Version 2 that does basically the same thing, but uses a chromosome analogue and a random "crossover" point: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414228785/editor
