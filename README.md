Prototype of what students would either create or modify (still pondering whether using a simple average of parental data/genes is an appropriate approximation of inheritance, especially since it just leads to a convergence to the average of the initial list if the user does nothing in each generation...caught between teaching genetic algorithms in CS in a simple way and simulating the biology in a more realistic way, which would increase the complexity): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/413457430/editor/
