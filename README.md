Prototype of what students would either create or modify (still pondering whether using a simple average of parental data/genes is an appropriate approximation of inheritance, especially since it just leads to a convergence to the average of the initial list if the user does nothing in each generation...caught between teaching genetic algorithms in CS in a simple way and simulating the biology in a more realistic way, which would increase the complexity): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/413457430/editor/

Version 2 that does basically the same thing, but uses a chromosome analogue and a random "crossover" point (mutation feature coming later): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414228785/editor
