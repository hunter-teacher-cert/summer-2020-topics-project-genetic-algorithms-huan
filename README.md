## Educator Resources for Learning about Genetic Algorithms
* https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/ (This chapter is a great primer on genetic algorithms)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zfeTw-uFCw&feature=emb_logo (This is the first of an extensive set of videos of live-coded genetic algorithms in JavaScript; it is the YouTube series version of the book above)
* http://boxcar2d.com/about.html (explains algorithm for orignal Flash boxcar2d, which you can still open in 2020 by allowing Flash in your browser settings)
* http://moe.stuy.edu/~dw/boxcardw/ (to get around Flash issues, you can alternatively play around with this version hosted by Stuyvesant)
* https://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/ (Some maths for those so-inclined, and also useful visualizations to help illustrate difference between basic genetic algorithms and evolution strategies, as well as more complex hybrid algorithms) 
* https://www.ceas3.uc.edu/ret/archive/2018/ret/docs/readings/Project%203/2018RET_ReadingMaterial_Introduction%20to%20Genetic%20Algorithms.pdf (If you are ready to get deep in the weeds of the historical "evolution" of the different branches of evolutionary algorithms: genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies are the focus. Honestly, after reading tons of different opinions on what distinguishes them, I'm still not sure what to think.)

## Educator Resources for Learning Scratch
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSgUBfi51uldLxNsADEYyXoXMuBTuR7om (Playlist tutorial for Scratch)
* https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Kids-Scratch-Coding-Book/dp/1507207972/ (Designed for kids, but useful for adults too)

## Educator Resources for Reviewing Biological Evolution

## Lesson Overview

## Lesson Materials

* Version 1 of Moth Evolution Simulation (uses averages of parent color values instead of crossing over): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/413457430/editor/

* Version 2 of Moth Evolution Simulation, which was a failed and aborted attempt at managing individual chromosomes for Scratch clones as list variables. I would not try this approach with students or yourself for your own sanity. Posted as an example of what not to do: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/413742155/editor

* Version 3 that manages a chromosome analogue using a global list storing all the genetic information of the entire population (named populationGenome) and includes a random "crossover" point with the potential for mutation during reproduction (also allows you to control chromosome size to see how this parameter can affect performance): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414228785/editor
